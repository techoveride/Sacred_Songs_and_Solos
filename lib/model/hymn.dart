          "As I wandered round the homestead, \nMany a dear familiar spot \nBrought within my recollection \nScenes I'd seemingly forgot; \nThere, the orchard — meadow, yonder — \nHere, the deep, old-fashioned well, \nWith its old moss-covered bucket, \nSent a thrill no tongue can tell. \n\n2\n Though the house was held by strangers, \nAll remained the same within; \nJust as when a child I rambled \nUp and down, and out and in ; \nTo the garret dark ascending — \nOnce a source of childish dread — \nPeering through the misty cobwebs, \nLo ! I saw my cradle bed. \n\n3\n Quick I drew it from the rubbish \nCovered o'er with dust so long : \nWhen, behold, I heard in fancy \nStrains of one familiar song, \nOften sung by my dear mother \nTo me in that cradle bed : \n\" Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber ! \nHoly angels guard thy bed ! \" \n\n4\n While I listen to the music \nStealing on in gentle strain, \nI am carried back to childhood — \nI am now a child again : \n'Tis the hour of my retiring, \nAt the dusky eventide ; \nNear my cradle bed I'm kneeling, \nAs of yore, by mother's side. \n\n5\n Hands are on my head so loving, \nAs they were in childhood's days; \nI, with weary tones, am trying \nTo repeat the words she says ; \n'Tis a prayer in language simple \nAs a mother's lips can frame : \n\" Father, Thou who art in heaven, \nHallowed, ever, be Thy name.\" \n\n6\n Prayer is over : to my pillow \nWith a \" good-night \" kiss I creep, \nScarcely waking while I whisper, \n\" Now I lay me down to sleep.\" \nThen my mother, o'er me bending, \nPrays in earnest words, but mild : \n\" Hear my prayer, O heavenly Father, \nBless, oh bless, my precious child ! \" \n\n7\n Yet I am but only dreaming : \nNe'er I'll be a child again ; \nMany years has that dear mother \nIn the quiet graveyard lain ; \nBut her blessed angel spirit \nDaily hovers o'er my head, \nCalling me from earth to heaven, \nEven from my cradle bed. \n",
